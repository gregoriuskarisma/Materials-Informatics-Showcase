            <h3>What is Materials Science?</h3>
            <p>
                Materials science is an interdisciplinary field focused on the discovery and design of new materials. It investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic properties. At its core, materials science explores how a material's processing and synthesis influence its structure and, consequently, its properties and performance. This fundamental relationship is often referred to as the "materials science tetrahedron," which links structure, properties, processing, and performance. By understanding these connections, materials scientists can create new materials with specific, desirable characteristics or enhance existing ones.
            </p>

            <h3>What is Data Science?</h3>
            <p>
                Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines principles from statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze complex data sets. The core objective of data science is to uncover patterns, make predictions, and inform decision-making. Practitioners, known as data scientists, utilize various tools and techniques, including machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, and data visualization to transform raw data into actionable intelligence.
            </p>

            <h3>The Relationship: Materials Informatics</h3>
            <p>
                Materials informatics is an emerging field at the intersection of materials science and data science. It involves applying data-driven methodologies to accelerate the understanding, discovery, and design of new materials. Materials science provides the fundamental domain knowledge, while data science offers the computational power to parse this information at an unprecedented scale. This fusion allows scientists to move from a trial-and-error approach to a more predictive and intelligent "inverse design" model, where desired material properties can be specified first to identify the most promising material compositions and structures for real-world applications.
