# Materials Informatics Showcase

The website will introduce and explore the field of Materials Informatics. This involves showcasing how data science and informatics tools are applied to materials science and engineering to accelerate discovery, understand properties, and optimize materials. It will cover fundamentals of materials data, common data analytics techniques in MSE, and illustrative case studies.

It should aim to introduce visitors to the field of Materials Informatics by clearly explaining its core concepts and significance. Thus, it should effectively demonstrate how data science and informatics methodologies are applied within materials science and engineering to advance the discovery, development, and understanding of materials. The site will strive to provide valuable information regarding the types of data crucial to materials research, outline common data analytics techniques employed in the field, and present illustrative examples or case studies that highlight the real-world impact and potential of this interdisciplinary area.

Often, information about this specialized intersection of materials science, data science, and engineering can be confined to academic journals or highly technical discussions. This website aims to tackle the problem of limited accessible introductory content by providing a clear, concise, and engaging platform where individuals can learn about the fundamental concepts, common practices, and impactful applications of Materials Informatics. It addresses the issue of a potential knowledge gap by serving as an informational resource that explains how data-driven approaches are revolutionizing the way new materials are discovered, developed, and understood, thereby making this exciting field more approachable to students.

The specialized knowledge required often resides within academic research groups and advanced industry settings, with publications typically aimed at experts rather than a general audience or those new to the domain. The rapid evolution of data science techniques and their application to materials also means that foundational, broadly accessible educational resources may lag behind cutting-edge developments. There's a scarcity of consolidated, introductory material that can effectively bridge the gap for students.
